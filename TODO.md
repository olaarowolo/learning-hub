# TODO: Missing en-index.html Files

Based on the references in yr*-index.html files, the following en-index.html files are missing and likely causing similar "Cannot GET" errors:

- yeargroups/KS1/y1/subjects/english/en-index.html
- yeargroups/KS1/y2/subjects/english/en-index.html
- yeargroups/KS2/y3/subjects/english/en-index.html
- yeargroups/KS2/y4/subjects/english/en-index.html
- yeargroups/KS2/y6/subjects/english/en-index.html
- yeargroups/KS3/y8/subjects/english/en-index.html
- yeargroups/KS4/y10/subjects/english/en-index.html
- yeargroups/KS4/y11/subjects/english/en-index.html
- yeargroups/KS5/y12/subjects/english/en-index.html
- yeargroups/KS5/y13/subjects/english/en-index.html

Note: KS2/y5/subjects/english/en-index.html has been created.
KS3/y7/subjects/eng/en-index.html exists (different path).
KS3/y9/subjects/english/en-index.html exists.

Each missing file needs to be created with year-specific theme colors, back links, and term links (autumn active, others disabled).

# Check for Other Subject Areas

Checked other subject areas (Mathematics, Science, History, Geography, Art) across year groups:
- Mathematics: All year groups have ma-index.html files in subjects/maths/ folders.
- Science: Some year groups have science.html files (e.g., KS3/y7), others have no links or folders.
- Other subjects (History, Geography, Art): Generally linked to "#" in yr*-index.html, no dedicated folders or index files.

No additional missing index files found for other subject areas.
